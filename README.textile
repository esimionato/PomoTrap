h1. PomoTrap

	PomoTrap is a simple time management tool. Its goal is to enhance personal focus and productivity. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique, and can do the following:
	* Track periods of work and relate it to activities on real projects
	* Track interruptions
	* Track rest and recreational periods
	* Provide metrics, reports, estimates
	The secret is to have a device to act as a timer and interact with the system. This is gesture-oriented. Conditioned reflexes are great tools. Just wind up the clock!


h2. Pomodoro Technique

	The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level.  It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations. 

h3. The original idea

	The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1990s. It was published on 2006. Its goals are to:
	* Alleviate anxiety from the feeling of _being late_
	* Keep a sustainable pace with the technique rhythm by using short iterations of 25 minutes, by not skipping breaks, and by focusing on one activity at a time.
	* Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
	* Increase awareness of your decisions
	* Boost motivation and keep it constant
	* Bolster the determination to achieve your goals
	* Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms
	* Improve your work or study process
	* Strengthen your determination to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations

h3. Modern ideas

	The book 'Pomodoro Technique Illustrated' was written by Staffan Noteberg. 
	* Released on December 2009
	* Published by The Pragmatic Programmers
	* Provides insights from Agile Software Methodologies and Cognitive Science research

h3. My ideas

	* 25-minutes size: lengths are not mandatory, configurable
	* Pair programming
	* Visibility
	* Alone, Intranet or Corporate network
	* the _Tomato_ also have a button you can tap it, in order to void the Pomodoro (when an external or fatal interruption occurs)
	* Integration with existing project management services

h2. Hardware

h3. The need of an external physical device

	* Gesture-oriented. Conditioned reflexes are great tools.
	* Focus Enabler. By always preparing with the same gestures and routines, the brain will self configure into the best mode to solve a particular kind of task. Like superstitious people. 
	* When you keep your clock visible on the desk, your teammates become aware of your technique and subconsciously more inclined to respect it.
	
h3. Open source hardware?

	I don't know how to do it yet! I will start by the software. And keep researching. 
	Maybe we can have many implementations to the device. iPhone, USB, an holographic panel. Who knows?
	I have received a few tips. THANK YOU!
