h1. PomoTrap

	PomoTrap is a simple time management tool. Its goal is to enhance personal focus and productivity. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique, and can do the following:
	
	* track periods of work and relate it to activities on real projects
	* track interruptions
	* track rest and recreational periods
	* provide metrics, reports, estimates
	
	The secret is using a device to act as a timer and interact with the system. This is gesture-oriented because conditioned reflexes are great tools. Just wind up the clock!


h2. Pomodoro Technique

* The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level. 
* It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations.
