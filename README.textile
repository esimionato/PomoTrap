h1. PomoTrap

	PomoTrap is a simple time management tool. Its goal is to enhance personal focus and productivity. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique, and can do the following:
	
	* track periods of work and relate it to activities on real projects
	* track interruptions
	* track rest and recreational periods
	* provide metrics, reports, estimates
	
	The secret is to have a device to act as a timer and interact with the system. This is gesture-oriented. Conditioned reflexes are great tools. Just wind up the clock!


h2. Pomodoro Technique

	The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level.  It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations. 

h3. The original idea

	The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1990s. It was published on 2006. Its goals are:
	
	* Alleviate anxiety linked the feeling of _being late_
	* Keep a sustainable pace with the technique rhythm by using short iterations of 25 minutes, by not skipping breaks, and by focusing on one activity at a time.
	* Enhance focus and concentration by cutting down on interruptions
	* Increase awareness of your decisions
	* Boost motivation and keep it constant
	* Bolster the determination to achieve your goals
	* Refine the estimation process, both in qualitative and quantitative terms
	* Improve your work or study process
	* Strengthen your determination to keep on applying yourself in the face of complex situations

h3. My ideas

	* Activity size - lengths are not mandatory

h2. Hardware

h3. The need of an external physical device

	* Gesture-oriented. 
	** Focus Enabler. By always preparing with the same gestures and routines, the brain will self configure into the best mode to solve a particular kind of task. Like superstitious people. 
	** Conditioned reflexes are great tools.
	* When you keep your clock visible on the desk, your teammates become aware of your technique and subconsciously more inclined to respect it.
	
h3. Open source hardware?

	I don't know how to do it yet! I will start by the software. And keep researching.
