h1. PomoTrap

	PomoTrap is a simple time management tool. Its goal is to enhance personal focus and productivity. It's based on the Pomodoro Technique, and can do the following:
	
	* track periods of work and relate it to activities on real projects
	* track interruptions
	* track rest and recreational periods
	* provide metrics, reports, estimates
	
	The secret is using a device to act as a timer and interact with the system. This is gesture-oriented. Conditioned reflexes are great tools. Just wind up the clock!


h2. Pomodoro Technique

* The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level. 
* It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations.

	*Stages*

# Choose - select one ore more activities from **Backlog** to **To Do Today** 
# Start/Track
## may have internal interruption - take note to **Unplanned & Urgent** and continue
## may have external interruption - register the reason, **void** the pomodoro 
## may end successfully - mark **done**
## must have a 5 minutes recreational **break**
# Record
## Add value
# Process/Visualize

Note: Stages 2-3 do repeat.

	*Glossary*
	
	1 pomodoro = 1 25-minutes effort - not mandatory
	1 activity spans one or more pomodoros
	3 small breaks followed by one longer break - not mandatory
	Activity Inventory == Backlog
