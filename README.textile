h1. PomoTrap

	Plan. Select. Focus. Report.
	
	I want to work on specific little tasks. And, in theory, do not get interrupted.
	
	This is a simple project intended to increase personal productivity. The goal is to support and mechanize the Pomodoro Techique. Providing an easy way to track record of what made you change your way.
	
	It works fine for people working alone or in small teams.
	
	This is almost zero process. We have a timer, things to do, will to do things, and lots of doing.
	
	Based on your 'sprint' planning, select a few tasks in the 'morning'. Prioritize and decide how much work will be done. (individual velocity)
	
	Input the tasks in the system. Start the first task by moving the Tomato (timer)!
	
    You will be warned when the time for the task finishes. If you get interrupted, tap the tomato, the clock will halt and the system will prompt you for the reason of the interruption when you get back.

	After one task. You do one short break. Every 4 tasks. You do a longer break.
	
	Each person knows how much tasks can be done in one day. 


h2. Briefing

* time trap ideas from "timetrap":http://github.com/samg/timetrap
* add feed planning with little tasks (25 minutes) (timer)
* extract ideas from Pomodoro technique
* easily track which tasks blown and which got interrupted and why
* Arduino: visually display time (tomato)
* Arduino: tap the tomato if the task gets interrupted (i.e. the phone rings)
* create interface to export to a few useful formats (Excel, Numbers, etc)
* reports, metrics

h2. Pomodoro Technique

* The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level. 
* It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations. 

** Tomato-shaped timer
** One activity at a time
** Time boxed activities
** The Timer: 
*** Start to focus. 
*** Wind up a timer which will wake you up later. 
*** Then you can reanalyze: is the activity that you focused on still the one that matters most?
** Get rewarded with a break.
** Sustainable pace with the technique rhythm by using short iterations of 25 minutes, by not skipping breaks, and by focusing on one activity at a time.
** Gesture-oriented. The mental transition between work and breaks is too slow. Conditioned reflexes are great tools. Do wind up the clock.
** Mistakes get repeated over and over. Record, Process and Visualize. Daily retrospective.
** The effort that one task takes is underestimated. Quantity estimating. The scope of a task is underestimated. Quality estimating.
** Your mind is invaded by competing thoughts. Write them down under: Unplanned & Urgent. 
** A complex and demanding methodology of working consumes your time. The Pomodoro Technique is ridiculous. So simple.
** You forget about the wholeness while in the flow. The break gives the brain a chance to absorb what you saw during the last task, and you will probably have at least three new ideas.
** Estimates are seen as promises. Cut off the unnecessary anxiety created by yourself and your co-workers. After 25 minutes of effort, you can focus on your activities even when you're close to a deadline.
** The process is not based on facts. Tracking. Daily retrospective. (metrics, completed, blown, interruptions, etc)
** Someone pushes work on you. The fight between "have-to" and "want-to" is known as the "terrible two". By actively selecting activities instead of getting them pushed, you increase your personal commitment.
** Perfectionism prevents action. 
** Fear of failure or criticism is a mental impediment.

* The Brain
** The Brain Stack: stem, limbic system, cortex, frontal lobe
** Brain Performance: 2% of body weight, 20% of the oxygen
** Rhythm: It’s the amount of time until the next break. The next point of rest. This is the break rhythm.
** Superstitious people are focus enablers. By always preparing with the same gestures and routines, the brain will self configure into the best mode to solve a particular kind of task.
** Conditioned and unconditioned reflexes. Training. Stimuli.
** Left Brain: experiences, rational. Right Brain: intuition, dreams, ideas.
** Savant. Idiot savant. Knowing idiot. Right hemisphere compensation.
