h1. PomoTrap

	Plan. Select. Focus. Report.
	
	I want to work on specific little tasks. And, in theory, do not get interrupted.


h2. Briefing

* time trap ideas from "timetrap":http://github.com/samg/timetrap
* add feed planning with little tasks (25 minutes) (timer)
* extract ideas from Pomodoro technique
* easily track which tasks blown and which got interrupted and why
* Arduino: visually display time (tomato)
* Arduino: tap the tomato if the task gets interrupted (i.e. the phone rings)
* create interface to export to a few useful formats (Excel, Numbers, etc)
* reports, metrics

h2. Pomodoro Technique

	The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level. It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations. 

** Tomato-shaped timer
** One activity at a time
** Time boxed activities
** The Timer: 
*** Start to focus. 
*** Wind up a timer which will wake you up later. 
*** Then you can reanalyze: is the activity that you focused on still the one that matters most?
** Get rewarded with a break.
** Sustainable pace with the technique rhythm by using short iterations of 25 minutes, by not skipping breaks, and by focusing on one activity at a time.
** Gesture-oriented. The mental transition between work and breaks is too slow. Conditioned reflexes are great tools. Do wind up the clock.
** Mistakes get repeated over and over. Record, Process and Visualize. Daily retrospective.
** The effort that one task takes is underestimated. Quantity estimating. The scope of a task is underestimated. Quality estimating. (Out Of Scope?)
** Your mind is invaded by competing thoughts. Write them down under: Unplanned & Urgent. 
** A complex and demanding methodology of working consumes your time. The Pomodoro Technique is ridiculous. So simple.
** You forget about the wholeness while in the flow. The break gives the brain a chance to absorb what you saw during the last task, and you will probably
