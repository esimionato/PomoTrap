h1. PomoTrap

	Plan. Select. Focus. Report.
	
	I want to work on specific little tasks. And, in theory, do not get interrupted.


h2. Briefing

* time trap ideas from "timetrap":http://github.com/samg/timetrap
* add feed planning with little tasks (25 minutes) (timer)
* extract ideas from Pomodoro technique
* easily track which tasks blown and which got interrupted and why
* Arduino: visually display time (tomato)
* Arduino: tap the tomato if the task gets interrupted (i.e. the phone rings)
* create interface to export to a few useful formats (excel, etc)
* reports, metrics

h2. Pomodoro Technique

	The Pomodoro Technique is similar to Agile methods such as Scrum and XP but at a “micro” level. It feels sort of like being a single-person team doing 25-minute iterations.

** Tomato-shaped timer
** One activity at a time
** Time boxed activities
